# Welcome to the repository template
Author: mesmoiron
Update: 11/01/2024

A repository template based on Nodejs

This repository can be used as a starter template for your own repositories. This one is bare bones, but it has a few things in place to make it easier to get started.01/20

### The documentation folder
Holds a way to document your project for others new to coding full stack applications. It helps to see what is already done, and how to navigate the code base. 
- Please keep it and create within it a map with your own nickname.
- Copy the example files and adjust them.

#### application_development_process.md
A document that describes the development process of the application from a personal perspective.

#### concepts.md
A document that describes the concepts and technologies used in the project.

#### important_file_notes.md
A document that describes the important files in the project. I think this is important, because navigating other code bases I quickly learned that some important information is so hidden or hard coded that future developers waste time to find that one piece of codde that must be adapted. Important files are database connections, customization of named entities, or anything that needs to be adapted to make it work on another platform.

#### list_of_files.md
A document that describes the files in the project listed by creation order. This is just practical way of keeping track of what you have done the previous session.

#### The team_notes folder is for general project files
Some of these can also be found on Google.
